# Tutorial: Building a web based user interface for 2D Navier-Stokes solver using FEniCSUI:

In this tutorial, we will go through the process it takes to design a web-based user interface for 2D Navier-Stokes solver using FEniCSUI library. The whole process including designing the front-end to build required menus, and tweaking the solver to accept the geometry and the boundary condition is explained in details.
