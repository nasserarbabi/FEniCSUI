FEniCS is finite element solver equipped with powerful and versatile toolkits to develop simulation models for various types of engineering problems. Even though the high-level Python interface facilitates building models for experienced programmers, the complexity arising from the lack of User Interface (UI) encumbers the implementation of FEniCS-based solvers in engineering applications. FEniCSUI project is built as an open-source web-based UI, easily customizable to meet the requirements of the FEniCS solvers, with the aim to disseminate the powerful infrastructure of FEniCS to a wider audience, including users of common finite element packages in industry and academia. The platform provides FEniCS developers with easy to use libraries to  customize a 3D CAD viewer and a sidebar menu to build an interactive, powerful UI for uploading the geometry, meshing and pre-processing of the model. The UI is supported by a backend server, hosted locally, that guides the user to provide the necessary input for each analysis, interactively. The FEniCSUI libraries comes with the mesh converters that prepares the mesh to be compatible with the FEniCS built-in mesh definition. The boundary conditions are well defined based on the user input file, and can be readily use to start the simulation.
